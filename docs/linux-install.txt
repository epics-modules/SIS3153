Installation of the sis3150 package on Linux requires the following
software pre-requisites:

- gcc compiler.  Installation has been tested with version 3.3.5 but
                 should work on other versions of the compiler.
- g++ compiler   Installation has been tested with version 3.3.5 but
                 should work with other compiler versions.
- cppunit        c++ unit testing framework.  If your distribution
                 does not have packages for this, it can be gotten
                 at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit
- libusb         If your distribution separates the development from
                 run time, both must be installed. (In particular,
                 usb.h must be in the standard compiler include paths.
- tcl            If your distribution separates development and run time,
                 you will need both packages.
- tk             If your distribution separtes distribution and run time
                 you will need both.


Your system must be configured to mount usb device special files in
/proc/bus/usb
To do this  The kernel must be configured with: CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS=y
(this is normal in most 2.6 kernels).
   



Once these prerequisites are installed, you must choose an installation
directory for the sis3150 usb software.  For the remainder of this
document we will assume you have chosen /usr/opt/sisusb.

First configure the software in the top level directory of the
unpacked tarball:

./configure --prefix=/usr/opt/sisusb

Other switches can be used to help configure locate
the software in non-standard directories:

--with-usb-headerdir=path  - Specify directory that has usb.h
--with-usb-libdir=path     - Specify directory that has libusb.{a,so}
--with-tcl-header-dir=path - Specify directory that has tcl.h,tk.h
--with-tcl-libdir=path     - Specify directory that has libtclx.y.{a,so} and
                             libtkx.y.{a.so}

For more switches to control the operation of configure:

./configure --help

The software will automatically locate the highest version of Tcl/Tk installed
from the set {8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5}


Once the software is configured:

make install

Will build the software and install it.


Post installation:
   In most systems, the files in /proc/bus/usb are not set to allow
write access by ordinary users.  The program /usr/opt/sisusb/bin/sishotplugd
can be run from the system startup rc scripts.  It monitors the system for
the addition of sis3150 devices.  When one is added, its device special file
mode is set to 0666 and firmware is loaded into the sis3150.

  It should be run:

/usr/opt/sisusb/bin/sishotplugd --firmware=/usr/opt/sisusb/etc/setup_8051.hex

/usr/opt/sisusb/bin/sishotplugd --help 

will give you a summary of the options this program supports.
The --debug switch prevents the program from becoming a daemon
and spews a great deal of information about what the program is
doing each poll for new devices.

Install notes for SuSE Linux 10.1
=====================================
You will need to use yast to install the following packages and their dependencies:

tcl-devel tk-devel gcc-c++

The cppunit test must be installed manuall.  Download this from
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit

untar the tarball and cd to its dir then as root:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make install

In SuSe 10.1, the usb devices are located in 
/dev/bus/usb rather than in /proc/bus/usb.

When using the sishotplugd to locate, set permissions
for device special files and download the firmware,
specify this location for he device speical files  using
the --root command e.g.:

/usr/opt/sisusb/bin/sisusbhotplugd --firmware=/usr/opt/sisusb/etc/setup_8051.hex \
                                   --root=/dev/bus/usb


Install notes for Scientific Linux/Red hat:
===========================================
You will need to install the following packages:
tcl-devel tk-devel gcc-c++

I have not found RPMs for the cppunit test framework.
You will therefore need to get it from 
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit

As root: Untar the cppunit tarball, cd to the directory it creates and:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make install
